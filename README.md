## Animation and Inputs 

### Perform the following steps to successfully complete this project:  

1. Create a new Monogame project.
2. Include a background image, another image (for a character or another game asset like a tree or a house) and two animation sequences in the project.
3. Add the animation classes that were covered in class to the project.
4. Load and display the graphical content.  

### Evaluation  
(1 mark) Make the window the same size as the background image.  
(5 marks) Include a background image as the background, another image in the foreground, and two properly-animated animation sequences.  
(2 marks) Add an animation sequence that is represented by a texture with more than one row (a multi-row sprite sheet). This will require that the CelAnimationSequence and/or the CelAnimationPlayer classes be modified.  
(1 mark) Have an animation sequence move around in response to key input.  
(1 mark) Have another, separate animation sequence move around in response to key inputâ€¯and animate differently depending on what direction it's moving in.  

### Additional Notes
- Any or all artwork may be generated or found on the Internet as long as the content is in the public domain.  
- No marks are assigned to the quality of the artwork since this is considered a programming course, however, the student is encouraged to make the best possible effort to find or generate quality content.
